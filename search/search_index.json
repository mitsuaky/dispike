I ask you to please remember this when opening issues or creating PRs. This library assumes you will be building an independent server to receive and send requests from/to Discord directly. This may cause higher bandwidth usages and incur costs with your cloud provider. If you prefer to listen over the Discord gateway, you should follow the progress of Discord.py instead. This library enables middleware to verify and accept connections only from Discord per documentation. Although Discord is trusted, you should operate this bot behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Caddy, because of this, the bot will only bind to localhost and accept local connections. If you want to do local testing before creating a server, you can use free tools such as Ngrok .

Open your web-browser (or postman) and try to test if your bot is reachable by going to the link that ngrok has provided and appending /ping You should see a message telling you it\u2019s reachable. Afterwards, go to discord and add the interaction point url, with the url that ngrok has provided appended with /interactions Press submit, and Discord will test your link by sending two requests, they should pass.","title":"Start the bot."},{"location":"tutorial/Running%20the%20bot/#run-some-commands","text":"Congrats, if tests pass, invite your bot into a server, and try out some bot commands!","title":"Run some commands."},{"location":"tutorial/Writing%20the%20handler/","text":"Writing your first handler. \u00b6 You\u2019ve created and registered your first command.
