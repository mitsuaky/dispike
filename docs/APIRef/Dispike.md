# Dispike

Initalizing Dispike will require
    - A valid client public key
    - A valid bot token
    - A valid client id (Dispike references this as an application id.)

All of these values can be found in the Discord Developer Portal.

## Run command

The run method is available as a convenience to quickly start a HTTP server that can accept connections.
While this HTTP server itself is production-ready, you should run this behind a reverse-proxy such as Nginx :star:, Apache or Caddy.

:star: - *Recommended*

:::dispike.Dispike.run
