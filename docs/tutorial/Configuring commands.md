## Configuring commands

Creating a command is very similar to creating it in JSON, however, this library will assist you in making sure the outcome is a valid schema for Discord. You should still learn how to build commands by reading the documentation on Discord.



Internally this is powered by [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). There are third-party plugins to integrate with your favorite IDEs to enable auto-completion when typing. 



???+ caution
	Autocompletion for creating new models under DiscordCommand, CommandChoice, CommandOption, SubcommandOption, CommandTypes **on VSCode is broken.** (follow the discussion here [samuelcolvin/pydantic#650](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/650), [microsoft/python-language-server#1898](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/issues/1898)). PyCharm appears to work using an external plugin.
	

Let's get started

```python
# Import
from dispike.creating import DiscordCommand, CommandOption, CommandChoice, CommandTypes

from dispike.creating import (
  DiscordCommand,
  CommandOption,
  CommandChoice,
  CommandTypes
)

```

These are the *models* that you will need to get started. Think of models as blueprints.

???+ info
	You can go more advanced by also importing [SubcommandOption], but that's more advanced and is not covered in this tutorial.



Let's create a command. The user will interact with this command such as.

```python
/wave <discord user to send wave to>
```

This is simple to create. Let's make it.



```python
command_to_be_created = DiscordCommand(
    name="wave" # this is the main command name.,
    description="Send a wave to a nice person! ðŸ‘‹ ",
    options=[
        CommandOption(
            name="person" # this is the attribute assigned to the value passed.,
            description="person to target" # this describes the value to pass,
          	required=True,
            type=CommandTypes.USER
        )
    ]
)
```



That's it, simple to create. 

Verify that the ``CommandOption.name`` is something you can name in a normal python function. 

Let's move to register this command.
